%\fixnote{Add a problem about the doubling/halving base-two multiplication algorithm....   Perhaps also include the Mysterious base-two game, or make it an activity.}


\begin{problem}Explain what it means for an operation \ding{72} to be
  \textit{associative}. Give some relevant and revealing examples and non-examples.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}\label{P:MA}Consider the following pictures:
\[
\includegraphics{../graphics/assMult.pdf}
\]
Jesse claims that these pictures represent $(2\cdot 3)\cdot 4$ and
$2\cdot (3\cdot 4)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is Jesse's claim correct? Explain your reasoning.
\item Do Jesse's pictures show the associativity of multiplication? If
  so, explain why. If not, draw new pictures representing $(2\cdot
  3)\cdot 4$ and $2\cdot (3\cdot 4)$ that do show the associativity
  of multiplication.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Explain what it means for an operation \ding{72} to be
  \textit{commutative}. Give some relevant and revealing examples  and non-examples.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Explain what it means for an operation \ding{72} to \textit{distribute}
  over another operation \ding{66}. Give some relevant and revealing
  examples and non-examples.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Explain what it means for an operation \ding{72} to be \textit{closed}
  on a set of numbers. Give some relevant and revealing
  examples and non-examples.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Sometimes multiplication is described as \textit{repeated
  addition}. Does this explain why multiplication is commutative? If
  so give the explanation. If not, give another description of
  multiplication that does explain why it is commutative.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}In a warehouse you obtain $20\%$ discount but you must pay a
  $15\%$ sales tax. Which would save you more money: To have the tax
  calculated first or the discount? Explain your reasoning---be sure
  to use relevant terminology.  In particular, which property 
of which operation(s) do you use?  
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Money Bags Jon likes to give a tip of $20$\% when he is at
  restaurants. He does this by dividing his bill by $10$ and then
  doubling it. Explain why this works.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Regular Reggie likes to give a tip of $15$\% when he is at
  restaurants. He does this by dividing his bill by $10$ and then
  adding half more to this number. Explain why this works.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Wacky Wally has a strange way of giving tips when he is at
  restaurants. He does this by rounding his bill up to the nearest
  multiple of $7$ and then taking the quotient (when that new number
  is divided by $7$). Explain why this isn't as wacky as it might
  sound.
%% \begin{teachingnote}
%% The problem above is fundamentally different than the other (related)
%% problems involving tips.
%% \end{teachingnote}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Cheap Carl likes to give a tip of $13\frac{1}{3}$\% when he is
  at restaurants. He does this by dividing his bill by $10$ and then
  adding one-third more to this number. Explain why this works.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Reasonable Rebbecca likes to give a tip of $18$\% when she is at
  restaurants. She does this by dividing her bill by $5$ and then
  removing one-tenth of this number. Explain why this works.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Can you think of and justify any other schemes for computing the
  tip?
