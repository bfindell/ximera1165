Two kayakers are traveling at a constant speed.  Doug travels $300$ meters in $8$ minutes, while Phil travels $350$ meters in $9$ minutes.  Who is traveling faster?

\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice[correct]{Phil travels faster, because he covers about $39$ meters per minute.}
	\choice{Doug travels faster, because he covers about $38$ meters per minute.}
	\choice{Phil travels faster, because he travels farther.}
	\choice{Doug travels faster, because he travels for fewer minutes.}
