\begin{problem}
Describe the set of integers. Give some relevant and revealing
  examples/nonexamples.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
The integers are the counting numbers, 0, and the opposites of the counting numbers.  
\[\{ \dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}\]
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Give some examples of contexts we might use to describe integers. What relevant properties should your context have?
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Common contexts include temperature, bank balance, and elevation.  A good context should have a sense of positive and negative, or a quantity and its opposite.
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

For the next few problems, identify which operation should be used to solve the problem.

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[red,fill=red] (1,0) circle (0.4cm);
\draw[red, fill=red] (0,1) circle (0.4cm);

\begin{example}
Imagine using a number line like the one below to solve the subtraction problem $-8 - 4$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[font=\Large]
\draw[<->] (-0.5,0) -- (12.5,0);
\foreach \x in {0,1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5,12}
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,3pt) -- (0pt,-2pt);
\draw (0,0) node[below]{$-4$};
\draw (1.5,0) node[below]{$-3$};
\draw (3,0) node[below]{$-2$};
\draw (4.5,0) node[below]{$-1$};
\draw (6,0) node[below]{$0$};
\draw (7.5,0) node[below]{$1$};
\draw (9,0) node[below]{$2$};
\draw (10.5,0) node[below]{$3$};
\draw (12,0) node[below]{$4$};
\end{tikzpicture}  
\end{center}
We begin by standing on the number line at the tick marked with $\answer[given]{-8}$.  Since 
we are subtracting, we face towards the \wordChoice{\choice{right} \choice[correct]{left}}.  We 
will move $\answer[given]{4}$ spaces \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{forward} \choice{backward}}, 
since $4$ is positive.  Where on the number line are we now? 

\begin{prompt}
We are located at the tick labeled $\answer[given]{-12}$.
\end{prompt}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Imagine using a number line like the one below to solve the subtraction problem $(-22) - (-54)$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[font=\Large]
\draw[<->] (-0.5,0) -- (12.5,0);
\foreach \x in {0,1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5,12}
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,3pt) -- (0pt,-2pt);
\draw (0,0) node[below]{$-4$};
\draw (1.5,0) node[below]{$-3$};
\draw (3,0) node[below]{$-2$};
\draw (4.5,0) node[below]{$-1$};
\draw (6,0) node[below]{$0$};
\draw (7.5,0) node[below]{$1$};
\draw (9,0) node[below]{$2$};
\draw (10.5,0) node[below]{$3$};
\draw (12,0) node[below]{$4$};
\end{tikzpicture}  
\end{center}
We begin by standing on the number line at the tick marked with $\answer[given]{-22}$.  Since 
we are subtracting, we face towards the \wordChoice{\choice{right} \choice[correct]{left}}.  We will 
move $\answer[given]{54}$ spaces \wordChoice{\choice{forward} \choice[correct]{backward}}, since 
$54$ is negative.  Where on the number line are we now? 

\begin{prompt}
We are located at the tick labeled $\answer[given]{32}$.
\end{prompt}
\end{example}


\begin{question}
In your own words, what is the difference between subtraction and negation?
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Subtraction is an operation, requiring two numbers.  With subtraction, we have two quantities that we are trying to relate.  With our models, subtraction requires some movement: removing chips, adding chips, or walking on the number line.  Negation, on the other hand, only requires a single value.  With negation, we are essentially just asking, ``What is the opposite?''  With our models, this is essentially a switching rather than a moving: we switch from black chips to red, or we face backward instead of forward.
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
