\begin{problem}
Use the definition of \textit{divides} to decide whether the
  following statements are true or false. In each case, an explanation must 
be given justifying your claim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $5|30$  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}$30=5\cdot6$.\end{hint}
\item $7|41$  \wordChoice{\choice{True}\choice[correct]{False}}
  \begin{hint}There is no integer solution to $41=7k$.  But $41=7\cdot5+6$. \end{hint}
\item $0|3$  \wordChoice{\choice{True}\choice[correct]{False}}
  \begin{hint}There is no integer solution to $3=0k$.\end{hint}
\item $3|0$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}The solution to $0=3k$ is $k=0$.\end{hint}
\item $6|(2^2\cdot 3^4\cdot 5 \cdot 7)$. \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint} $6=2\cdot3$, and $2\cdot3$ appears in factorization of the second number.\end{hint}

  \begin{hint} $1000 = 2^3\cdot5^3$, and these primes appear enough times in factorization of the second number.\end{hint}

%\begin{problem}
%\textit{Incognito's Hall of Shoes} is a shoe store that just
%  opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. At the moment, they have 100
%  pairs of shoes in stock. At their grand opening 100 customers showed
%  up. The first customer tried on every pair of shoes, the second
%  customer tried on every 2nd pair, the third customer tried on every
%  3rd pair, and so on until the 100th customer, who only tried on the
%  last pair of shoes.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Which shoes were tried on by only 1 customer?
%\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 2 customers?
%\item Which shoes were tried on by exactly 3 customers?
%\item Which shoes were tried on by the most number of customers?
%\end{enumerate}
%Explain your reasoning.

%\begin{problem}
%Lisa wants to make a new quilt out of $2$ of her favorite
%  sheets. To do this, she is going to cut each sheet into as large
%  squares as possible while using the entire sheet and using whole
%  inch measurements. 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item If the first sheet is $72$ inches by $60$ inches what size
%  squares should she cut? 
%\item If the second sheet is $80$ inches by $75$ inches, what size
%  squares should she cut? 
%\item How she might sew these squares together? 
%\end{enumerate}
%Explain your reasoning.

%  millet seed and 24 cups of sunflower seeds in their feeder.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item How many total scoops of seed (millet or sunflower) are required
%  if their scoop holds 1 cup of seed?
%\item How many total scoops of seed (millet or sunflower) are required
%  if their scoop holds 2 cups of seed?
%\item How large should the scoop be if we want to minimize the total
%  number of scoops?
%\end{enumerate}
%Explain your reasoning.
%\end{problem}
%
%\begin{problem}
%Consider the expression:
%\[
%d\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{} r}
%$q$ &\, R\,$r$\\ \cline{1-1}
%\big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}}
%$n$ 
%\end{tabular}
%\end{tabular}
%\qquad\text{where}\qquad
%\begin{tabular}{l}
%$d$ is the divisor \\
%$n$ is the dividend \\
%$q$ is the quotient \\
%$r$ is the remainder
%\end{tabular}
%\]
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Give $3$ relevant and revealing examples of long division with
%  remainders.
%\item Given positive integers $d$, $n$, $q$, and $r$ how do you know
%  if they leave us with a correct expression above?
%\item Given positive integers $d$ and $n$, how many different sets of
%  $q$ and $r$ can you find that will leave us with a correct
%  expression above?
%\item Give $3$ relevant and revealing examples of long division with
%  remainders where some of $d$, $n$, $q$, and $r$ are negative.
%\item Still allowing some of $d$, $n$, $q$, and $r$ to be negative,
%  how do we know if they leave us with a correct expression above?
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{problem}
%
%\begin{problem}
%State the \textit{Division Theorem} for integers. Give some
%  relevant and revealing examples of this theorem in action.
%\item Explain what it means for an integer to \textit{not} divide
%  another integer. That is, explain symbolically what it should mean
%  to write:
%\[
%a \nmid b
%\]
%\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the following:
\begin{align*}
20 \div 8 &= 2 \text{ remainder }4, \\
28 \div 12 &= 2 \text{ remainder }4.
\end{align*}
Is it correct to say that $20 \div 8 = 28 \div 12$? \wordChoice{\choice{Yes}\choice[correct]{No}}

Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
The answer ``$2 \text{ remainder }4$'' is not a single number but rather a pair of numbers (a quotient and a remainder) that have different meanings.  In particular, the 2 is about different things: groups of 8 versus groups of 12.  Calling this pair of numbers ``equal'' is questionable.  
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}

%\begin{problem} Explain how if 
%\[
%n = dq_0 + r_0

%\label{P:NNP}Matt is a member of the Ohio State University

%  negative it means \textit{face South and take $|x|$ steps.} If $y$
%  is positive it means your step is a \textit{forward step of $y$
%    inches.} If $y$ is negative it means your step \textit{is a
%    backward step of $|y|$ inches.}

%Stewie decided to count the pennies he had in his piggy bank. He
%  decided it would be quicker to count by fives. However, he ended
%  with two uncounted pennies. So he tried counting by twos but ended
%  up with one uncounted penny. Next he counted by threes and then by
%  fours, each time there was one uncounted penny. Though he knew he
%  had less than a dollars worth of pennies, and more than 50 cents, he
%  still didn't have an exact count. Can you help Stewie out? Explain
