\begin{problem}Explain why the following ``joke'' is ``funny:'' \textit{There
  are $10$ types of people in the world. Those who understand base two
  and those who don't.}
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
In base two, 10 is actually two.  So people who do not understand base two will not get the joke.  
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}

\begin{problem}You meet some Tripod aliens, they tally by threes. Thankfully
  for everyone involved, they use the symbols $0$, $1$, and $2$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can you explain how a Tripod would count from $11$ to $201$? Be
  sure to carefully explain what number comes after $22$.
  
12, 20, 21  $\answer[format=string]{12, 20, 21}$
(22, 100, 101)  $\answer{(22, 100, 101)}$

$\answer{102}, \answer{110}, \answer{111}, \answer{112}, \answer{120}, \answer{121}, \answer{122}, \answer{200}, \answer{201}$
  
\item What number comes immediately before $10$?  $\answer{2}$
\item Before $210$? $\answer{202}$
\item Before $20110$? $\answer{20102}$
  Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}You meet some people who tally by sevens. They use the symbols
  $O$, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What do the individual symbols $O$, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and
  $F$ mean?
\item Can you explain how they would count from $DD$ to $AOC$? Be sure
  to carefully explain what number comes after $FF$.
\item What number comes immediately before $AO$?  $ABO$? $EOFFA$?
  Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Now, suppose that you meet a hermit who tallies by
  thirteens. Explain how he might count. Give some relevant and
  revealing examples.
% The following problem used to begin $1/6$ of $30$ is $4$, but that allowed  
% proportional reasoning to give the correct answer.  The numbers have been changed.
