\begin{problem}
Jess is solving the equation $6x+13 = 25$.  Here is their work.

\[
25 - 13 = 12 \div 6 = 2
\]
\end{problem}

What is the issue with this work?
\begin{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
The Rational Root Theorem says that if $\pm \frac{a}{b}$ is a root of a polynomial (written in lowest terms), then $a$ must be a factor of the constant term, and $b$ must be a factor of the leading term.

For the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x + 4$, which of the following could be rational roots of $p(x)$?   (Do not solve this problem by plugging in the answers to the polynomial!)
\begin{selectAll}
	\choice[correct]{$1$}
	\choice[correct]{$-1$}
	\choice{$\frac{3}{2}$}
	\choice{$-\frac{2}{3}$}
	\choice[correct]{$-4$}
	\choice{$\frac{1}{4}$}
