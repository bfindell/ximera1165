\begin{problem}
A sequence has first two terms $1, 2, \dots$.  What type of sequence is this?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{An arithmetic sequence.}
\choice{A geometric sequence.}
\choice{A quadratic sequence.}
\choice[correct]{It is impossible to tell.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{hint}
	If we do not know the rule for generating the terms of this sequence, can we be sure we know the next term?

\begin{problem}
Sylvie has a bank account which contained $\$400$ back when interest rates were high.  When she graduated from high school, she decided to invest the money in a certificate of deposit (CD) that yielded $10\%$ interest, compounded annually.  

Would we use a geometric sequence to describe the value of her CD?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes, this is a geometric sequence.}
\choice{No, this is not a geometric sequence.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
Fill out the following table corresponding to the value of her CD $n$ years later. (Enter the exact amount; do not round to the nearest cent.)
\[
\begin{array}{c|c} \hline
n & \text{Value} \\ \hline
0 & \answer{400}\\
1 & \answer{440} \\
2 & \answer{484} \\
3 & \answer{532.4}\\
4 & \answer{585.64}\\
5 & \answer{644.204}\\
6 & \answer{708.6244}\\
7 & \answer{779.48684}\\
%8 & \answer{857.435524}\\
\end{array}
\]

\begin{problem}
Write a recursive formula for the value of Sylvie's account in year $n$, using ``Next'' and ``Now'' to describe the situation.

\begin{prompt}
Sylvie account value: \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{Next} \choice{Now} \choice{$n$} \choice{400} \choice{1.1} \choice{0.1}} $=$ \wordChoice{\choice{Next} \choice[correct]{Now} \choice{$n$} \choice{400} \choice{1.1} \choice{0.1}}  $\times$  \wordChoice{\choice{Next} \choice{Now} \choice{$n$} \choice{400} \choice[correct]{1.1} \choice{0.1}}.
\end{prompt}


\begin{problem}

Write an explicit formula for $f(n)$, the value of her CD in year $n$.

\begin{prompt}
Sylvie CD will be valued at $f(n) = \answer[given]{400(1.1)^n}$ in $n$ years.
\end{prompt}

\begin{problem}
Seth is in a lab, measuring the amount of a decaying substance.  He knows that each day, he expects to have $\frac{11}{12}$ of the amount he had the previous day.  If he began with $90$ grams of the substance, predict how many grams he will have in the future.

How much of the substance will Seth expect to have on day $5$?
\begin{prompt}
Seth expects to have $\answer[given]{90(11/12)^{5}}$ grams of the substance.
\end{prompt}

\begin{problem}
Consider a sequence whose first term is $-2$, whose second term is $1$, and which has a constant second difference $\Delta \Delta (n) =3$.

What type of sequence is this?

\choice{Arithmetic.}
\choice{Geometric.}
\choice[correct]{Quadratic.}
\choice{Something else.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
Consider a sequence whose first term is $-2$, whose second term is $-1$, and which has a constant second difference $\Delta \Delta (n) =3$.

Fill out the following table of values for this sequence.  Then, find explicit formulas for both $\Delta(n)$ and $f(n)$.

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \hline
n & f(n) & \Delta(n) & \Delta \Delta(n) \\ \hline
1 & -2 & \answer{1} & \answer{3} \\
2 & -1 & \answer{4} & \answer{3} \\
3 & \answer{3} & \answer{7} & \answer{3} \\
4 & \answer{10} & \answer{10} & \answer{3} \\
5 & \answer{20} & \answer{13} & \answer{3} \\
6 & \answer{33} & \answer{16} & \answer{3} \\
\end{array}
\]

\begin{prompt}
We find that $\Delta(n) = \answer[given]{1+3(n-1)}$ and that $f(n) = \answer[given]{-2 + \frac{3}{2} (n)(n-1) - 2(n-1)}$.
