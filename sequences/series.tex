\begin{problem}
A series is the $\answer[format=string]{sum}$ of consecutive terms from a(n) $\answer[format=string]{sequence}$.  

An arithmetic series is the $\answer[format=string]{sum}$ of consecutive terms from a(n) $\answer[format=string]{arithmetic sequence}$ (two words).  

A geometric series is the $\answer[format=string]{sum}$ of consecutive terms from a(n) $\answer[format=string]{geometric sequence}$ (two words).  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the series: 
\[
1+3+5+7+\dots+99
\]
First compute the sequence of partial sums: 
\[
\begin{array}{c|c} \hline
\text{No. of terms} & \text{Value} \\ \hline
1 & \answer{1} \\
2 & \answer{4} \\
3 & \answer{9}\\
4 & \answer{16}\\
5 & \answer{25}\\
6 & \answer{36}\\
\end{array}
\]
\begin{problem}
Make a conjecture: The sum of the first $n$ terms of this series is $\answer{n^2}$. 

In the series
\[
1+3+5+7+\dots+99
\]
there are $\answer{50}$ terms, so the sum is $\answer{50^2}$.  

\begin{problem}
Noticing patterns is called 
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{inductive} \choice{productive} \choice{deductive} \choice{reductive}}
reasoning, which is very important in mathematical problem solving. 

But in mathematics, we usually aim to know also \textbf{when} (the conditions under which) and \textbf{why} patterns work, which requires  
\wordChoice{\choice{inductive} \choice{productive} \choice[correct]{deductive} \choice{reductive}} reasoning to reach careful, logical conclusions.  

Here is picture that can help explain why the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers works out so nicely: 
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sumOdds.png}
\end{image}

The red lines organize the dots into groups. Moving from the top left toward the bottom right, the number of dots in these groups are $\answer{1},\answer{3},\answer{5}$, and so on.  More generally, if $1$ is the first group, then the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ group has $\answer{2n-1}$ dots, which is the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ odd number.  

Furthermore, through the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ odd number, the dots are organized so that they form a square of side length $\answer{n}$, for a total of $\answer{n^2}$ dots.  

This compelling example illustrates an important result:  The sequence of partial sums of a(n) $\answer[format=string]{arithmetic}$ series is a $\answer[format=string]{quadratic}$ function of the number of terms summed.  

The following examples show that patterns are sometimes much harder to see.  
\end{problem}
\end{problem}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Consider the arithmetic series: 
\[
5+8+11+14+\dots+101
\]
First compute the sequence of partial sums: 
\[
\begin{array}{c|c} \hline
\text{No. of terms} & \text{Value} \\ \hline
1 & \answer{5} \\
2 & \answer{5+8} \\
3 & \answer{5+8+11}\\
4 & \answer{5+8+11+14}\\
5 & \answer{5+8+11+14+17}\\
6 & \answer{5+8+11+14+17+20}\\
7 & \answer{5+8+11+14+17+20+23}\\
\end{array}
\]

\begin{problem}
Even suspecting that this sequence is a quadratic function, the pattern is hard to see.  

For arithmetic series, an important and useful technique is as follows. Call the series $S$, and then write out the series forward and backward, with the terms aligned as shown:  
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccc}
S & = &     5  & + & 8      & + &  11    & + & \cdots & + & 95 & + & 98 & + & 101 \\
S & = & 101 & + & 98 & + & 95 & + & \cdots & + & 11     & + &    8   & + & 5
\end{array}
\]
To the right of the equals sign, the terms in each column sum to $\answer{106}$, and there are $\answer{33}$ terms.  (Be careful:  It is easy to be ``off by one.'')

So on the right, these equations sum to $\answer{106\cdot 33}$.  

But on the left, the equations sum to $\answer{2S}$.  So the sum of the original series is 
$\answer{106\cdot 33/2}$. 

\begin{problem}
Let's generalize this approach to find the sum of the first $n$ terms of the arithmetic series that begins $5+8+11+\dots$.  

First, we need a formula for the $n^{th}$ term in the sequence $5, 8, 11, \dots$.  

If we call 5 the \textbf{first} term, then the $n^{th}$ term is $\answer{5+3(n-1)}$.  
\begin{feedback}
One way of reasoning:  Begin with $5$ and add $(n-1)$ copies of the common difference, which is $3$.  
\end{feedback}

\begin{problem}
For ease of algebra, let's write $5+3(n-1)$ as $3n+2$.  Then proceed as above:  
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccc}
S & = &     5  & + & 8      & + &  11    & + & \cdots & + & (3n-4) & + & (3n-1) & + & (3n+2) \\
S & = & (3n+2) & + & (3n-1) & + & (3n-4) & + & \cdots & + & 11     & + &    8   & + & 5
\end{array}
\]
The terms in each column sum to $\answer{3n+7}$, and there are $\answer{n}$ terms, so on the right, these equations sum to $\answer{n(3n+7)}$.  

But on the left, the equations sum to $\answer{2S}$.  So the sum of the original series is 
$\answer{n(3n+7)/2}$, which is indeed a $\answer[format=string]{quadratic}$ function of $n$.  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider a sequence whose first term is $-2$, whose second term is $1$, and which has a constant second difference $\Delta \Delta (n) =3$.

What type of sequence is this?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Arithmetic.}
\choice{Geometric.}
\choice[correct]{Quadratic.}
\choice{Something else.}
\end{multipleChoice}


\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
Consider a sequence whose first term is $-2$, whose second term is $-1$, and which has a constant second difference $\Delta \Delta (n) =3$.

Fill out the following table of values for this sequence.  Then, find explicit formulas for both $\Delta(n)$ and $f(n)$.

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \hline
n & f(n) & \Delta(n) & \Delta \Delta(n) \\ \hline
1 & -2 & \answer{1} & \answer{3} \\
2 & -1 & \answer{4} & \answer{3} \\
3 & \answer{3} & \answer{7} & \answer{3} \\
4 & \answer{10} & \answer{10} & \answer{3} \\
5 & \answer{20} & \answer{13} & \answer{3} \\
6 & \answer{33} & \answer{16} & \answer{3} \\
\end{array}
\]

\begin{prompt}
We find that $\Delta(n) = \answer[given]{1+3(n-1)}$ and that $f(n) = \answer[given]{-2 + \frac{3}{2} (n)(n-1) - 2(n-1)}$.
\end{prompt}
