\begin{problem}
{\em I have a recipe which calls for $4$ cups of flour.  If I make $\frac{1}{3}$ of a batch, how many cups of flour will I use?}

Which type of division is the above problem?
\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice{The problem is a how many groups division problem.}
	\choice{The problem is a how many in one group division problem.}
	\choice[correct]{The problem is not a division problem.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
{\em I have a recipe which calls for $6$ cups of flour.  If I use $\frac{7}{5}$ of a cup of flour, how many batches can I make?}

Which type of division is the above problem?

\begin{problem}
{\em We know that $\frac{7}{12}$ of a cup of water fills $\frac{3}{8}$ of a jug.  If we pour $\frac{1}{2}$ of a cup of water into the jug, how many more cups can I add later?}

Which type of division is the above problem?

\begin{problem}
A neighborhood watch committee patrols a route which is $\frac{18}{5}$ of a mile long.  If Mrs. Little walks $\frac{2}{3}$ of a mile each day along the route, what fraction of the route is Mrs. Little patrolling?

Use a picture to answer this problem!

\begin{prompt}
	Mrs. Little patrols $\answer{\frac{5}{27}}$ of the route.
\end{prompt}
