\begin{problem}Given a polynomial
\[
p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x+ a_0
\]
can you find two numbers $L$ and $U$ such that $L \le p(x) \le U$ for
all $x$? If so, explain why. If not, explain why not.
\end{problem} \begin{problem}Consider all polynomials of the form
\[
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x+ a_0
\]
where the $a_i$'s are integers. If you substitute an integer for $x$
will you always get an integer out? Explain your reasoning.
\end{problem} \begin{problem}Consider the following polynomial:
\[
p(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x}{2}
\]
Will $p(x)$ always returns an integer when an integer is substituted
for $x$? Explain your reasoning.

\begin{problem}Fix some integer value for $x$ and consider all polynomials of
  the form
\[
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x+ a_0
\]
Where the $a_i$'s are integers greater than or equal to $0$. Which
numbers can be represented by such polynomials? Explain your
reasoning.

\begin{problem}Consider $x^2 + x + 1$. This can be thought of as a ``number'' in
  base $x$. Express this number in base $(x+1)$, that is, find $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$ such that 
\[
b_2(x+1)^2 +b_1(x+1) + b_0 = x^2 + x + 1.
\]
Explain your reasoning.

\[
b_2(x-1)^2 +b_1(x-1) + b_0 = x^2 + 2x + 3.

\[

to find the base $(x-1)$ coefficients of $p(x)$.
