  coefficients are equal? Explain your reasoning.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Is it true that numbers are equal if and only if their digits
  are equal? Explain your reasoning.

\begin{problem}Explain how to add two polynomials.  Explain, in particular, how ``collecting like terms'' is
an application of the properties of arithmetic.

\begin{problem}Here is an example of the polynomial division algorithm:
\begin{image}  
\begin{tikzpicture}  
\node at (0,0) {
$x^2 + 3x + 1\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{}r} 
$x-3$~~&\, R\;$9x+4$\\ 
\cline{1-1}
\Big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}} \bigstrut[t] $x^3 + 0x^2 + x + 1$\\ 
$x^3 + 3x^2 + x$ \\ 
\divrule{0}{11}  
\bigstrut[t]~~~$-3x^2 +0x + 1$\\
~~~$-3x^2-9x -3$\\
\divrule{4}{12}
~~~~~~~~~~$9x + 4$
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}$
