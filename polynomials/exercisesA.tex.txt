\begin{problem}Explain what is meant by a \textit{polynomial} in a variable $x$.  
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Informally: A polynomial in $x$ is an algebraic expression that can be written as a sum of terms, each of which is a whole-number power of $x$ multiplied by some real number.  

Formally: For a whole number $n$, a \emph{polynomial (in $x$) of degree $n$} is an expression that can be written in the form 

$$a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1x + a_0$$

where the $a_i$'s are real numbers and $a_n\ne 0$.  
A \emph{polynomial function of degree $n$} is a function that can be defined by a polynomial.  

\end{hint}

\begin{problem}Is it true that polynomials are equal if and only if their
  coefficients are equal? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Yes.  This is the fact we used to complete the previous two problems.
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Is it true that numbers are equal if and only if their digits
  are equal? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
For whole numbers written in the same base, the answer is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{yes}\choice{no}}.  

For decimals, the answer is \wordChoice{\choice{yes}\choice[correct]{no}}.  [Note: We will learn why and how later in the course.] 

For fractions, of course, the answer is \wordChoice{\choice{yes}\choice[correct]{no}}.  For example, $\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}$, and the ``digits'' of the fraction on the left are clearly different from those of the fraction on the right. 
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Explain how to add two polynomials.  Explain, in particular, how ``collecting like terms'' is
an application of the properties of arithmetic.  
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Use the associative and commutative properties to rearrange the sum so that like terms are consecutive.  Then use the distributive property to ``collect'' the like terms. For example, $3x^2+4x^2 = (3+4)x^2 = 7x^2$. 
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Explain how to multiply two polynomials.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Use the distributive property:  Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.  Then collect like terms.  
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}Here is an example of the polynomial division algorithm:
\begin{image}  
\begin{tikzpicture}  
\node at (0,0) {
$x^2 + 3x + 1\,\begin{tabular}[b]{@{}r@{}r} 
$x-3$~~&\, R\;$9x+4$\\ 
\cline{1-1}
\Big)\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}l@{}} \bigstrut[t] $x^3 + 0x^2 + x + 1$\\ 
$x^3 + 3x^2 + x$ \\ 
\divrule{0}{11}  
\bigstrut[t]~~~$-3x^2 +0x + 1$\\
~~~$-3x^2-9x -3$\\
\divrule{4}{12}
~~~~~~~~~~$9x + 4$
\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}$
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Describe how to perform this algorithm:  
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
This is very much like the long division algorithm for counting numbers: 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Write part of the quotient;
\item Multiply that part of the quotient by the divisor;
\item Subtract that product from the dividend; 
\item Repeat until the remaining part of the dividend is has a degree less than the degree of the divisor. 
\end{enumerate}
Note that, in the last step, what counts as ``less than'' is different for dividing polynomials than for dividing counting numbers.
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}

%\item Describe how to perform this algorithm.

%  demonstrating that you understand the algorithm.

Quotient: $\answer{x^2+2x-4}$; remainder: $\answer{7}$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Find the quotient and divisor when dividing $x^3+4x^2-1$ by $x^2+1$.

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}State the \textit{Division Theorem} for polynomials. Give some
  relevant and revealing examples of this theorem in action.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Informally, when dividing a polynomial by a (non-zero) polynomial, we can always find a sensible quotient and remainder (both polynomials).  More formally, given $n(x)$ and a non-zero divisor $d(x)$, we can find $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ such that $n(x) = \answer{d(x)q(x)+r(x)}$ with the degree of $r(x)$ \wordChoice{\choice{greater than}\choice{equal to}\choice[correct]{less than}} the degree of $d(x)$.  
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}
