How many zeros are at the end of the following numbers:
\begin{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Decide whether the following statements are true or false. In
  each case, a detailed argument and explanation must be given
  justifying your claim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $7|13a$, then $7|a$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}Follows from Euclid's Lemma because 7 is prime.\end{hint}
\item If $6|49a$, then $6|a$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}Because $6=2\cdot3$ is not prime, we handle its prime factors separately.  

  Because $6|49a$, it must be that $2|49a$.  Then $2|a$ by Euclid's Lemma. 
  
  Similarly, because $6|49a$, it must be that $3|49a$.  Then $3|a$ by Euclid's Lemma. 
  
  Because both $2|a$ and $3|a$, it follows that $6|a$.
  \end{hint}

  \begin{hint}Counterexample: $a=2$.\end{hint}
\item If $14|22a$, then $14|a$.  \wordChoice{\choice{True}\choice[correct]{False}}
 \begin{hint}Counterexample: $a=7$.\end{hint}
\item $54|931^{21}$.  \wordChoice{\choice{True}\choice[correct]{False}}
 \begin{hint}$54$ is even (i.e., it has $2$ as a factor), but $931^{21}$ is not.\end{hint}
\item $54|810^{33}$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
 \begin{hint}From $54 = 2\cdot3^3$ and $810 = 2\cdot 5\cdot 3^4$, 
 we can see that $54|810$.\end{hint}

\begin{problem}
Joanna thinks she can see if a number is divisible by 24 by
  checking to see if it's divisible by 4 and divisible by 6.  She
  claims that if the number is divisible by 4 and by 6, then it must
  be divisible by 24.

Lindsay has a similar divisibility test for 24: She claims that if a
number is divisible by 3 and by 8, then it must be divisible by 24.

Are either correct?  Explain your reasoning.

Joanna is \wordChoice{\choice{correct}\choice[correct]{incorrect}}.  
Lindsay is \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{correct}\choice{incorrect}}.  
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}For Joanna, the least (positive) counterexample is $\answer{12}$.  Her method doesn't work because the $gcd(6,4) = \answer{2}$, so there are common multiples \emph{before} $6\cdot4$.  

Lindsay's method, works because $gcd(3,8) = \answer{1}$, so every common multiple of $3$ and $8$ is also a multiple of $3\cdot8$.  
\end{hint}
\end{freeResponse}

%Could you ever choose some combination of tickets (you can use as many

%If so, give the correct combination of tickets. If not explain why
%not.

\begin{problem}
\label{P:helper} Decide whether the following statements are true
  or false. In each case, a detailed argument and explanation must be
  given justifying your claim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $a^2|b^2$, then $a|b$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
\begin{hint}However many times a prime appears in the prime factorizations of $a$, it will appear twice as many times in the prime factorization of $a^2$.  Same idea for $b$ and $b^2$. 
Because $a^2|b^2$, we know that $b^2=ka^2$ for some integer $k$.  
Both $b^2$ and $a^2$ must have an even number of factors any prime, which implies that $k$ must also have an even number of factors of that prime.  
This means that $k$ is a perfect square, which is to say it is the square of some integer $c$.  Substituting $k=c^2$, we find that $b^2=c^2a^2=(ca)^2$.  Assuming $a, b, c > 0$, we have $b=ca$, which means that $a|b$.
\end{hint}
\item If $a|b^2$, then $a|b$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}Counterexample: $a=12$, $b=6$.\end{hint}
\item If $a|b$ and $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, then $a = 1$.  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
  \begin{hint}Because $a|b$ there is an integer $k$ such that $b=ak$.  Because $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, every prime in the factorization of $b$ is not a factor of $a$ and therefore must be in $k$.  This implies that $k$ has the same prime factorization of $b$.  Assuming $a, b, k>0$, this means that $b=k$ and therefore $a=1$.\end{hint}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers.  If $x^2 = 11\cdot y$, what can you say about $y$? Explain your
  reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Imagine comparing the prime factorizations of $x$, $x^2$, and $y$.  However many times a prime appears in the prime factorization of $x$, it will appear twice as many times in the prime factorization of $x^2$.  Because $11|(11y)$, it follows that $11|x^2$.  Because $x^2$ must have an even number of factors of $11$, $y$ will have an odd number of factors of $11$.  And $y$ will have an even number of each of its other prime factors.

\begin{problem}
Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers.  If $x^2 = 25\cdot y$, what can you say about $y$? Explain your
  reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Because $x^2$, $25y^2$, and $25$ are all perfect squares, $y$ must also be a perfect square
